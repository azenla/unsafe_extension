=====

Library for performing operations on the unmanaged native code and data.

Version: 0.0.2

Initial release. Use at your own risk!

**Installation**

The package manager `pub` does not support `pre` and `post` install scripts, you should install an extension manually.

$ cd PUB_CACHE/hosted/pub.dartlang.org  
$ cd unsafe_extension-0.0.2  
$ pub get  
$ cd bin  
$ dart setup.dart  

Easy? Thanks to `pub`!
